// Complete exercise 3 from the previous lesson, but write your code in the external.js file
// instead of in the console.
// When the exercise asks you to use a number, instead use a prompt to ask the user for that number.
// Use an alert to show the results of each problem.

// Write some JavaScript code, that is, variables and operators, to describe the following scenarios.
// Do not worry about the real operations to get the values, the goal of these exercises is to
// understand how real world conditions can be represented with code.

// 3a
// You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days,
// they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). If price for a
// movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?

// 3b
// Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you
// a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350. How much will you
// receive in payment for this week? You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google and 4 hours
// for Amazon.

// conflict with her current schedule.
