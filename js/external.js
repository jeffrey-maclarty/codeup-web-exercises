// EXERCISE 1
// Use the alert function to show a message that says 'Welcome to my Website!'.
alert("Welcome to my Website!");

// EXERCISE 2
// Use a prompt to ask for the user's favorite color. Use the user's response to alert
// a message that says that the color entered is your favorite color too.
// For example, if the user enters "blue", your code should alert a message that says:
// "Great, blue is my favorite color too!"
let userColor = prompt("What is your favorite color?");

alert("Great, " + userColor + " is my favorite color too!");

// EXERCISE 3
// Complete exercise 3 from the previous lesson, but write your code in the external.js file
// instead of in the console.
// When the exercise asks you to use a number, instead use a prompt to ask the user for that number.
// Use an alert to show the results of each problem.

// Write some JavaScript code, that is, variables and operators, to describe the following scenarios.
// Do not worry about the real operations to get the values, the goal of these exercises is to
// understand how real world conditions can be represented with code.

// 3a
// You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), Brother Bear (for 5 days,
// they love it), and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). If price for a
// movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?

// 3b
// Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, Amazon and Facebook, they pay you
// a different rate per hour. Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350. How much will you
// receive in payment for this week? You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google and 4 hours

// 3d

// and the offer has not expired. Premium members do not need to buy a specific
// amount of products.
